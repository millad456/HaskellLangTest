In Skel.hs,

I used the tutorial code for everything from line 281 and below is given or from the tutorials.

The slides and tutorial contents were used to write the code.

ChatGPT and BingAI were used for resolving compilation and syntax errors. 

Structure for cabal test and the file structure were taken from assignment 1 with help from Samir. Specifically in main.hs 

Kumar helped with implementation for rename and freeVars in skel.hs
